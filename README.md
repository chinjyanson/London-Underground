# Trasport-for-London-Underground Mobile App

## Final Result

## How to run

To run the backend, just run the commmand `.bat`, it should automatically start the cache and also get the server running in `port 5000` locally.





## Requirements
- In our program we use cache. Make sure to download _*Apache Ignite* (Binary Version)_ from this link: https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi. Then navigate to the directory in cmd, then run `bin\ignite.bat`
- To fuffil the rest of the conditions please `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Troubleshooting
*Common Problems*: 
- API_URL in app.json is not correct for different devices, go to app.json to change to backend location (do not use localhost, mobile cannot communicate)
